def sort(width: float, height: float, length: float, mass: float) -> str:
    """
    Sorts packages based on their dimensions and mass.

    📦 Rules:
    - A package is **bulky** if its volume (Width x Height x Length) is >= 1,000,000 cm³
      or if any of its dimensions (width, height, length) is >= 150 cm.
    - A package is **heavy** if its mass is >= 20 kg.

    🏷️ Stacks:
    - **REJECTED**: If the package is both heavy AND bulky.
    - **SPECIAL**: If the package is EITHER heavy OR bulky (but not both, as that's REJECTED).
    - **STANDARD**: If the package is NEITHER heavy NOR bulky.

    Args:
        width (float): Width of the package in cm.
        height (float): Height of the package in cm.
        length (float): Length of the package in cm.
        mass (float): Mass of the package in kg.

    Returns:
        str: The name of the stack ("STANDARD", "SPECIAL", or "REJECTED") where the package should go.
